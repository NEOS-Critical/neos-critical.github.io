Good start!

Now, let us walk you through the process of building a sample Mini App project.

The sample project is the NEAR ME app. It has 3 tabs and pages:

- List of places near the user 
- Map that shows the places next to the user
- About app 

It demonstrates basic features such as:

- Create a structure and style for the title, tab bar, and app pages
- Navigating to another screen
- Using a custom component (map)
- Requesting the user permission (location)
- Making an API call
- Using the device's native capabilities (location)
- Using 3rd party packages
- Import files

Let's go!
