# Bluetooth 
`This section displays list of Bluetooth related APIs for the Mini App.

***

- [openBluetoothAdapter](bluetooth-api#wxopenbluetoothadapterobject-object)
- [getConnectedBluetoothDevices](bluetooth-api#wxgetconnectedbluetoothdevicesobject-object)
- [getBluetoothDevices](bluetooth-api#wxgetbluetoothdevicesobject-object)
- [getBluetoothAdapterState](bluetooth-api#wxgetbluetoothadapterstateobject-object)
- [closeBluetoothAdapter](bluetooth-api#wxclosebluetoothadapterobject-object)

# wx.openBluetoothAdapter(Object object)

Initializes the Bluetooth module. This API is called only once when the central device/peripheral mode is enabled on iOS respectively, and the corresponding `mode` needs to be specified.

# Parameters

**Object object**

| Attribute | Type | Valid Value | Default | Required | Description |
| :-------- | :--- | :---------- | :------ | :------- | :---------- |
| mode | String | `central`  <br />`peripheral` | central | No | Bluetooth mode, which can be central or peripheral mode and is required for iOS only. |
| success | Function |  |  | No | Callback function for successful API call. |
| fail | Function |  |  | No | Callback function for failed API call. |
| complete | Function |  |  | No | Callback function for API call end (executed for both successful and failed calls). |

> ðŸ“˜ Notes
> 
> - Other Bluetooth APIs can be used only after [wx.openBluetoothAdapter()] is called. Otherwise, they will return an error ( errCode=10000 ).
> - If the user turns off Bluetooth or the phone does not support Bluetooth, an error ( errCode=10001 ) will be returned when [wx.openBluetoothAdapter](bluetooth-api#wxopenbluetoothadapterobject-object) is called, indicating that the Bluetooth feature is unavailable on the phone. At this point, the Mini App Bluetooth module is intialized.

### Sample code

```javascript
// JavaScript
wx.openBluetoothAdapter({
  success (res) {
  	console.log(res)
  }
})
