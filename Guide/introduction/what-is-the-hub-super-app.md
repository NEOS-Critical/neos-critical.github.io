# What is the NEOS Hub?
***
NEOS Hub is the Super App Platform-as-a-Service.

NEOS Hub helps streamline how people interact with digital touch points by offering access via a single app. Anyone using a NEOS Hub Super app will enjoy common features supported by the Super App platform.

Your Mini App can leverage the existing user base and benefit from the four pillars, that are the foundation of the NEOS Hub ecosystem, to get to market faster.

## Why choose to build a Mini App on NEOS Hub?

### Our competitive advantage

By combining Identity, Payment, Communication, and AI tools services in one Super app, NEOS Hub is the leading Super App Platform-as-a-Service in the Middle East. There is no all-in-one Super App application like this.

## 4 pillars of the NEOS Hub

A combination of the four pillars is what makes NEOS Hub unique. These are Identity, Payment, Communication and Personalised Services via AI. These features in a single app mean that there is no time or funds wasted on developing your own component or trying to integrate a third-party option.

### Identity

NEOS Hub is an ID aggregator, which allows the linking of 3rd party identities. This helps users and developers onboard into Mini Apps seamlessly.​

### Financial Services / Transactions

NEOS Hub currently enables e-commerce payments. We are working on wider payment services, including wallet services.​

### Chat (Messaging & VoIP)

NEOS Hub enables chat and voice out-of-the-box.

### Personalised Services via AI

NEOS Hub is currently integrating with Safana, a Virtual Agent, with English and Arabic as a core feature. We can integrate with any bots etc. as requested by Lusail. ​

Stemming from the Identity, Payment, and Communication pillars, there are pre-built components your Mini App can utilize without having to spend the time and money to develop or integrate on your own. This includes onboarding, mapping services (GIS), and more.

### Unparalleled speed to MVP

Because of the digital products being built across the GCC, we’re able to move fast. This means you will be able to deliver world-leading experience to end users.

### Data services available for use

Ready-to-use data services are there for your Mini App to benefit from. This includes data storage, data ingestion, user profiling, and more.

### It’s free for developers to build on the NEOS Hub Mini App platform
