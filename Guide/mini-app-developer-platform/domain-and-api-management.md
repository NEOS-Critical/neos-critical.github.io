### Request domain

In order to call an API on a real device when running the Mini App, you need to whitelist the base URL of the API end point, you can do that from the `Domain management` section from the side left menu.

### Service domain

IF your Mini App uses a web view component, the URLs visited on the web view have to be whitelisted in the service domain section. you don't need to add the whole URL, just the base URL is sufficient.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Whitelisting a domain is applicable to all Mini Apps under the same developer account.
