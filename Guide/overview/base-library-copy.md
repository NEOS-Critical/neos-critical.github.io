# Base Library 
This section explains the Base Library of Mini App.
*** 
After a new app is released, the new version of the base library will go through a 12- to 24-hour beta test in the backend until it is available on the user device. The capabilities of the Mini Program need to be supported by the Mini App. Each base library can only run on the corresponding Mini App version. A higher version of the base library is not compatible with a lower-version Mini app.
