> ðŸ“˜ Notes
> 
> - Other Bluetooth APIs can be used only after [wx.openBluetoothAdapter()] is called. Otherwise, they will return an error ( errCode=10000 ).
> - If the user turns off Bluetooth or the phone does not support Bluetooth, an error ( errCode=10001 ) will be returned when [wx.openBluetoothAdapter](doc:bluetooth-api#wxopenbluetoothadapterobject-object) is called, indicating that the Bluetooth feature is unavailable on the phone. At this point, the Mini App Bluetooth module is intialized.

### Sample code

```javascript JavaScript
wx.openBluetoothAdapter({
  success (res) {
  	console.log(res)
  }
})

### Sample code

```javascript JavaScript
wx.getBluetoothAdapterState({
  success (res) {
  	console.log(res)
  }
})
```

# wx.closeBluetoothAdapter(Object object)

Disables the Bluetooth module. Calling this method will close all the established connections and release system resources. We recommend you call it together with [wx.openBluetoothAdapter](doc:bluetooth-api#wxopenbluetoothadapterobject-object) after using the Bluetooth module.
