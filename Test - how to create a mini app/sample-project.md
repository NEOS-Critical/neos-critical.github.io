# Sample Project 
*** 
Good start!

Now let us help you to create your first Mini app.

The sample project is the NEAR ME app. 

It has 3 tabs and pages:

- List of places near the user and 
- Map that shows the places next to the user
- About app 

It demonstrates basic features such as:

- [ ] Create a Structure and Style for the title, tab bar, and app pages
- [ ] Navigating to another screen
- [ ] Using a custom component (map)
- [ ] Requesting the user permission (location)
- [ ] Making an API call
- [ ] Using the device's native capabilities (location)
- [ ] using 3rd party packages
- [ ] import files

Let's go!
